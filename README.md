## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find my collection of notes that I've taken while learning and working on different projects. These notes serve as a reference for myself and may also be useful for others interested in similar topics.

## Organization

The repository is organized into different folders based on the subjects or topics of the notes. Each folder may contain subfolders for better categorization, and each note is typically stored as a markdown (.md) file.
