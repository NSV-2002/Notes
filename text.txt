#this is the complete step by step guide for working with git.

* step 1: create a directory in your local system 
          (command :- mkdir test ) {mkdir}=make directory. {test}=directory name.

* step 2: open the directory 
          (command:- cd test) {cd}= change directory. 

* step 3: initiate the directory to git.
          (command :- $git init)

* step 4: now create the file you want 
          ( command :- vim text.txt) {vim}=virtual text editor.

* step 5: now add the file to git repository
          (command :- $git add text.txt)

* step 6: we need to connect our local directory to the remote git repository
          (command :-git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git)

* step 7: now we need to commit our file to the remote repository
          (command:- git commit -m "Initial commit")

* step 8 pust your changes to the git hub repository
          (command:- git push -u origin master)

//////// In this way you can create a directory and add it to your git hub account ////////
